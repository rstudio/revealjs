This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

# Slide with Bullets

- Bullet 3

# Slide with R Code and Output

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

# Slide with table

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(cars))
```

You can use any external R package **gt** or **flextable** to create beautiful tables.

# Slide with Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

# Slide with Quote

    transition: zoom
```
# Slide background {data-background-color="#33ffd8"}

This slide has another background changed using `data-background-color`. 

Next vertical slides show variants

## Using an image 1 {data-background-image="https://cran.r-project.org/Rlogo.svg"}

Which will be used in whole background

## Using an image 2 {data-background-image="https://cran.r-project.org/Rlogo.svg" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px"}

## Using a gif {data-background-image="https://media4.giphy.com/media/vKHKDIdvxvN7vTAEOM/giphy.gif" data-background-size="contain" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"}

## What to customize

https://revealjs.com/backgrounds/

# Background transitions {background-color="#4d7e65" data-background-transition="zoom"}

The transition of the background revealing can be customized using `data-background-transition` attribute on a per slide basis or globally using the option configuration: 

```yaml
output:
  revealjs::revealjs_presentation:
    background_transition: "zoom"
```

# Link between slides {#link}

You can easily link between slides using the slide number 

[link to the first slide](#0)

## Or using a specific id

[Link to the slides about links](#link)

## You can also create link for navigation

[Link to previous horizontal slide](){.navigate-prev}

Click following arrow to go to previous slides

![arrow up](https://static.slid.es/reveal/arrow.png "Click me"){.navigate-up style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1); transform: rotate(180deg);"}

# Speaker view

A speaker view is available if you activate the `notes` pluggin

````yaml
output:
  revealjs::revealjs_presentation:
    self_contained: false
    reveal_plugins: notes
````

On any slide, pressing S key will enter Speaker view in another window with a timer, preview of next slides and speaker 

::: notes
You can then add notes using a div of class `notes`
:::

# Taking a pause

Press B or . to hide the content of the slide at your convenience.

# Auto slide {data-autoslide=10000}

You can set the configuration `autoSlide` (in millisecond) to automatically switch to next slide after a certain time. 

This can be done on a per slide basis using `data-autoslide` or globally using
````yaml
output:
  revealjs::revealjs_presentation:
    autoSlide: 10000 #10 sec
````
# Auto slide next

It was activated automatically by previous slide. 

* Setting globally `autoSlide` to 0 (the default) deactivate auto progress but allow per slide config using `data-autoslide` attribute.
* Setting to an integer value in millisecond activates for all slides. A special control should appear on the slide footer. Using `autoSlideStoppable: false` will prevent any action to stop the slide progress. 
* Setting to `autoSlide: false` will disallow auto progress even with the attributes.
